Publish an rmarkdown into wiki repo

If this is the first time you are going to publish in a wiki, you
must follow these steps:
\enumerate{
\item The wiki repository must be cloned to a local working folder. To do this
first go to the wiki tab of your repository and you will need to manually
create the first wiki page. If you don't do this it will tell you that the
repository does not exist.
\item Once you have created the wiki home page, you will need to clone the wiki
repository just like you would any other repository on your computer (using
the link that is made available to you once you create the wiki home page).
\item Once you have cloned the wiki on your computer, what you should indicate
in the \code{publica_wiki} function is the\code{ path_wiki_repo}. This is the full
address on your computer where this repository you cloned is located. For
example: \verb{/home/client/project/wiki_repo}
}
}
\examples{

\dontrun{
publish_wiki(report = "eda.Rmd",
             path_wiki_repo = "/home/cliente/proyecto/wiki_repo")
}
