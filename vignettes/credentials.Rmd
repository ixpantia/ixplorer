# **Where to get my credentials?**

If you have wondered where you can get your API token or are not sure of the
url, project name 'upstream', repository name ixplorer or the username, this
vignette will help you get them.

# **Getting the API token**

The first thing you need to do is go to the **settings** section which is under
your account avatar.

Once there, there is a tab with the name of **applications**. Click on this
option and then the option to generate an API token will be available. To
obtain it, you have to give the API a name and then create it.

After clicking on **Generate Token** you will see a number made up of multiple
digits. This is the API token. Be sure to write it down and save it somewhere
as it is the credential you will need to put into the **authentication gadget**
to gain access to your repository data from RStudio.

# **Getting my ixplorer url**

This segment is simple since it is only necessary to search for your ixplorer
environment on the internet and copy the url.

As an example, the url credential of the ixplorer in the image below would be:

  - https://prueba.ixpantia.com

## Project name

This is the name of the project where your repositories of interest are hosted.
Be careful to write the name of the upstream project as it appears in the url.
For example, in the image below we can see that the name of the project is
**Credit risk model and API** and contains two repositories.

## Repository

When you start the session, you will basically be focused on a single
repository. If we continue with the example, we have two repositories under
_Credit risk model and API_: **mod_credit_risk** and **api_credit_risk**.

If we want to work on the repository **mod_credit_risk** we have to write this
name in the authentication gadget.

## User name

Here we write only the name of the user that is used to login to your ixplorer
environment account. In this example we would have username **sasha**

## **How would the authetication gadget look like?**

The gadget currently has 6 total slots to fill. The first time you access the
gadget through the addin in Addins or the add_token() function, it is displayed
only asking for the url of your ixplorer environment. In case it is detected
that there are no pre-entered credentials for your environment, the following
spaces will be displayed asking for your token, username, name and repository.
There is also the additional option to choose your language of preference.
Later the gadgets that are called will be displayed in this language. The
gadget would then look like the image below

When there are previously saved credentials for your url environment you will
be directed to the second tab of the gadget "ixploring" where you can select
one from your previously saved environments, change your project and later your
repository. This tab would look like the image below.

Once the authentication gadget closes you may be prompted yo enter a password.
This password may be required for your instance the next time you use any
function of ixplorer, it is recommended to store it properly in a password
manager on your computer. This step is especially important for those who use a
shared computer.

If your intention is not to save the credentials permanently on the computer
you can always delete them once your work session is over. For this the
function delete_credentials() or eliminar_credentiales() are used.
