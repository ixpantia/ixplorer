## Purpuose

The purpose of this dictionary is to provide you with short explanations about
the main components of ixplorer. This will help you with the flow of daily work
of your project and to communicate better with your science team of data.

## What's a project?

A project is the workplace where specific goals are pursued. Within of a
project you can have several repositories up to the necessary amount to satisfy
the organization.

A project can be, for example, a credit risk model and under this project you
can find the repository "analisis_exploratorio", the repository "model" and the
repository "package_r", thus keeping the code separate according to different
purposes but all referred to the same project theme.

The project page will look similar to this:

## What's a repository?

A repository can be seen as a folder where all the files are kept. These files
can be shared with other team members to get started to collaborate on
different tickets that involve tasks.

There are ways to keep a repository organized whatever you're working on. a
package or in an RStudio project with R or other files.

Our recommendation is:

- Have a data folder within the repository where all the data sources.
- An images folder where the images or binary files are included.
- The .Rproject must be visible
- The R scripts must be in a folder and the names must be without spaces,
  periods or a combination of upper/lower case.

## What is an upstream?

Upstream is the standard name we use to refer to the "central" repository which
contains clean code and functional code. From this central repository, team
members should to make your fork to be able to work on your tickets.

## What's a fork?

This is a "copy" of the central repository. It will be under your username. You
fork a repository when you want to contribute code to the repository central.
By the time you are ready to offer your improvements, you make a pull request.
In your fork (unless you make a request merge) only your work will affect your
repository, not the core repository. You must be aware that all changes in the
central repository will not automatically appear in your fork unless that you
follow due process with git to update your repository.

## Tickets

Tickets are created to document actions that need to be performed in a
repository. Tickets can have different categories:

  - Question: a question related to the topics of the repository.
  - New: a new feature that can be achieved in code.
  - Improvement: an idea or observation that can be realized.
  - Error: when something in the code does not work and needs to be resolved.
  - Wish: a characteristic that can be realized but does not have priority.
 
## Milestones

One way to organize your project priorities is by assigning tickets to each of
the milestones you define. An example of a milestone might be the release of a
package.

## wiki

The repository place where information can be documented, defined and
maintained This info may be necessary to communicate to your team to answer
questions and stay informed about the project.

## Release

A release is created to set the release of your code, which means: that you
have a deadline where the code will be ready, so that will be reviewed, clean
and functional.

All this code can be an R package, it will be labeled as a release, which marks
a specific point in the history of the project.

## Settings

In this place you can configure the repository, the people who have access, who
can collaborate, write or change code. If you want to remove the repository,
change rights, this is the place to do it.
